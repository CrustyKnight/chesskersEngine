# Chesskers API
The Chesskers API is a full python implementation of the University High School original chesskers: a chess variant that mixes the mechanics of chess with the movement of chesskers. 

## Chesskers 
- Chesskers essentially works like chess: pieces move the same, most (but not all) rules are still in place. However, taking pieces results in that piece doing a small hop (what we refer to as a landing space) over the piece (like in checkers, you know?).
